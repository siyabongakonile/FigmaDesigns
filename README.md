## DJ Website
This is a design for a DJ's to use to advertise themselves, their music, services they offer and means of contact for bookings, queries and addresses. The design is integrated with the PJMusicPlayer that I am currently developing for playing the dj's songs. You can view the project on Figma using this link [DJ Website Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SjWKnnqZDUxLKPf3GnYFwv/DJ-Website?node-id=0%3A1).
